PingPong Study Dashboard
===

A web app to support the PingPong College RCT study.

> [!NOTE]
> The README below contains instructions on how to run the main PingPong app locally. The PingPong Study app is based off the same infrastructure as the main PingPong app. Detailed instructions for Study-specific development are coming soon.

# Development

## Running locally

You need these things to use the app locally.
 - Postgres Database
 - OpenFGA Authz server
 - Python / Poetry to run the API
 - Pnpm to run the FrontEnd.
 - OpenAI API Key (for using the app)

The easiest way to run the DB and OpenFGA is through Docker.


### Quick setup

First, get access to the `config.dev.toml` file and put it in the root of your repo.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Do not** proceed with the Quick Setup before getting access to `config.dev.toml`. The Quick Setup script below will fail if you do so.

Assuming you have a Docker environment available,
the easiest way to start up development services is with the following script:

```
./start-dev-docker.sh
```

This will set up the DB (with all tables), OpenFGA, and the Python API in containers.

This does **not** build/start the Web UI; for that, see the [`web/pingpong/README.md`](web/pingpong/README.md).
You may also wish to stop the `pingpong-srv-1` container and replace it with an uncontainerized Python API for development (see below for instructions).


#### Running the Python API outside of Docker

The **Quick Setup** runs the Python API inside of Docker.
This makes development tedious if you need to make changes to the Python code.

To run the Python API outside of Docker,
first stop the `pingpong-srv-1` container in Docker (but keep the DB and authz containers running).

Next, create a file in the root of the repo named `config.local.toml`.
You can customize this file how you want, but the basic settings you need are:

```toml
log_level = "DEBUG"
public_url = "http://localhost:5173"
development = true

[db]
engine = "postgres"
host = "localhost"
user = "pingpong"
password = "pingpong"
database = "pingpong"

[auth]

[[auth.secret_keys]]
key = "not actually a secret!"

[authz]
type = "openfga"
scheme = "http"
host = "localhost"
store = "pingpong"
cfg = "./pingpong/authz/authz.fga.json"
key = "devkey"

[email]
type = "mock"
```

Then, run the following command to start the dev server:

```
CONFIG_PATH=config.local.toml poetry run fastapi dev pingpong --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0 --reload
```

This will start a `uvicorn` server that will automatically reload with code changes as you make them.


#### First time logging in

When you have everything running (including the UI; see [`web/pingpong/README.md`](web/pingpong/README.md)),
go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
You should log in with a real email address you have access to.
In development, this user will be automatically promoted to a super user,
with full permissions to create new classes, etc.

You will receive a real email to that address with a link to log in to the dev server.
Click the link, you will be in!

#### Creating test users

You can use the `+` email trick to create test user accounts.

For example, if `joenudell@testdomain.com` is my real email address, I will use that as my super-user account.
Then, from the PingPong UI I can invite `joenudell+student1@testdomain.com` to be a student,
and `joenudell+teacher1@testdomain.com` to be an instructor in a class.

All of the login emails will be sent to `joenudell@testdomain.com`, so you can easily work with multiple users with different permissions.


## Adding new DB Migrations
If you need to modify the database, make your changes in the SQLAlchemy code, then run:

```
poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<description of change>"
```

Verify the migration is correct, check it into the repo, and apply it to the database by running:

```
poetry run python -m pingpong db migrate
```

## Authz

The OpenFGA authorization server has a [playground](http://localhost:3000/playground) that may be useful.

## Canvas Authentication

Pingpong supports syncing of group user rosters through Canvas. To set up the integration, set up the following in `config.toml` (or the respective local config file):
- The URL where the application should send Canvas API requests to.
  <br>`canvas_url = "http://canvas.docker"`
- The Canvas Client ID to use for authentication requests.
  <br>`canvas_client_id = "00000000"`
- The Canvas Client Secret to use when requesting authentication tokens.
 <br>` canvas_client_secret = "XXXXXXXXXX"`

Finally, make sure that the callback URL for Pingpong once the request is authenticated is set up as `[Pingpong Base Url]/api/v1/auth/canvas/` on the [Canvas Admin panel](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-manage-developer-keys-for-an-account/ta-p/249).

### Canvas local deployment:
You can follow the instructions to install a local instance of [canvas-lms](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms/wiki/Quick-Start) for testing.

## Backend / API

We use `Python 3.11` and [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) for package management.

If you want to develop outside of a container using a live-reload server, do the following:

Run `poetry install --with dev` to install dependencies.

The following command runs the API in development mode:
```
poetry run uvicorn pingpong:server --port 8000 --workers 1 --reload
```

NOTE: in development the API uses a mock email sender that prints emails to the console rather than sending them.
Remember to check the console when you are expecting an email!

### Custom API Config

See the `config.toml` file for default configuration settings used in development.

You can use another config file if you want to customize your setup,
such as `config.local.toml` which will not be tracked:

```
CONFIG_PATH=config.local.toml poetry run python ...
```

## Frontend / UI

See the [`web/pingpong`](web/pingpong/README.md) directory for instructions.
